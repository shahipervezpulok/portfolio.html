            <p>"Avenger" refers to someone who seeks to obtain justice or retribution for a perceived wrong or harm that has been committed against themselves or others. Avengers are typically driven by a desire to right a perceived injustice or to punish those responsible for it. They may take matters into their own hands or seek legal means to achieve their goal, depending on the situation and the context.</p>
